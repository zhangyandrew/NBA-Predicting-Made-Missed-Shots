##### Contributer:
- Andrew Zhang

This project was created as my final project for my graduate level Data Mining class. It utilizes Machine Learning techniques in order to gauge the accuracy of predicting made or missed shots from an NBA Shot log.

Some of the **Machine Learning** techniques utilized

The data consists of variables such as Make or Miss, Shot Distance, Shot Clock, Shooter, Distance of Closest Defender, and Home or Away.
